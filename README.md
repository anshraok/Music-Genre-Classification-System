Developed a deep learning-based system to classify music tracks into genres using audio feature extraction and CNNs using GTZAN dataset. Employed LibROSA to extract features like MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast. Finetuned the neural model using adapter modules to improve classification across multiple genres. Conducted inference across a diverse test set, demonstrating effective multi-class classification using temporal and spectral audio features.
